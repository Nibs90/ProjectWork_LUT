# Project_work

This is my project work of Anytime-course: Software Development Skills: Mobile 2020-21.
The project have a simple blackboard, where a user can write things. 
The app does not have a text-file, where writes will save, just writing and when the app close out of memory, things will be cleared.  
Project also include a button, what guided to window with a picture of squash.

To run a project, just download the source files and run a project.
